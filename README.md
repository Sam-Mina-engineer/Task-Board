# Task-Board
Task Board using Day JS
I am reading through the original HTML starter code and I noticed that it is linked to Bootstrap.
I am now reading through the Bootstrap documentation to see how it can help me build the modal form in the HTML. 
I wrote the HTML for the modal form using Bootstrap. 
I chose h5 because it is not large but not too small either.
I ran the browser and the form works. Time for a Git push. 
I wrote the first function for generating a unique task id. It was extremely straightforward. I just used ++ to increment. 
To create the task card I used the Day JS task dueDate and I formated it to reat MMMM D, YYYY. And then I made it so that it will 
return a dynamically generated HTML string. Time for another Git push.
