# Task-Board
Task Board using Day JS
I am reading through the original HTML starter code and I noticed that it is linked to Bootstrap.
I am now reading through the Bootstrap documentation to see how it can help me build the modal form in the HTML. 
I wrote the HTML for the modal form using Bootstrap. 
I chose h5 because it is not large but not too small either.
I ran the browser and the form works. Time for a Git push.
